### 📚 Notes from the Orientation Session🔥

**What is Backend Engineering?**

Backend engineering is a branch of software engineering that focuses on the server-side of web development. It involves the development and maintenance of the servers, databases, APIs, and other components that make up the back-end of web applications. 

**What is the role of a Backend Engineer**

1. Design decision making and creation of high-level design (HLD) for architecture
2. Writing APIs and interacting with databases
3. Implementing business logic
4. Maintaining deployment processes and conducting testing
5. Performing maintenance and documenting work
6. Collaborating with front-end engineers, database administrators, and other stakeholders
7. Writing clean and efficient code
8. Building robust and scalable systems to support business needs
9. Ensuring seamless integration with front-end systems
10. Providing a seamless user experience.

**Example** - Scalability of hotspot (Home Screen Crashed on back button (Live Cricked Match → Dhoni got out) )

Flow of Code, ability to read and understand code.

The main focus during the course is going to be outcome
- end to end Microservices based applications
- deploy app, database on public cloud like aws
- testable JS applications
